# Example for using the parallel merge sorting algorithm

## Run the following command in linux terminal:
```shell
./merge_sort 1
```
## You would get the result:

> For 1 threads, time taken for execution: 0.004560 seconds
> The first 20 sorted numbers:
> 114,    115,    128,    135,    136,    149,    155,    165,    182,    188,    196,    202,    215,    221,    236,    240,    251,    263,    277,    286, 

 The argument "1" is the number of threads. So you can change "1" to "2", "4", "8".
